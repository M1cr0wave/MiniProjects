# Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game repository! This project is an enhanced version that features a 2-player mode and introduces a computer opponent. The game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is currently hosted on [Netlify](https://tiktactoev2.netlify.app/).

## Features

- **2-Player and Computer Gameplay:** Enjoy a classic game of Tic Tac Toe with a friend or challenge a computer opponent.
- **Winning Logic:** The game uses arrays to check for a winning combination, ensuring a fair and accurate determination of the winner.
- **Responsive Design:** The user interface is designed to work seamlessly on various screen sizes.

## Computer Opponent

In this version, I've added a random number generator that allows the computer to make moves. I have also learned about the minimax algorithm, and you can find my explanation [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kpn2b3lHIFTSM08wpmm62R1qoqckZ2x9/view?usp=sharing).

## Inspiration

I drew inspiration from the following videos:
- [Tic Tac Toe AI with Minimax Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trKjYdBASyQ)
- [Coding Challenge: Minimax Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-hh51ncgDI&t=0s)

I plan to implement the minimax algorithm in my V3 of the app.
