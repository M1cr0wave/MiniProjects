# Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game repository! This project is a simple 2-player version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game utilizes arrays to implement the winning logic and is currently hosted on [Netlify](https://tiktactoev1.netlify.app/).

## Features

- **2-Player Gameplay:** Enjoy a classic game of Tic Tac Toe with a friend.
- **Winning Logic:** The game uses arrays to check for a winning combination, ensuring a fair and accurate determination of the winner.
- **Responsive Design:** The user interface is designed to work seamlessly on various screen sizes.

## Future Plans

I am currently working on an enhanced version that will allow players to face off against the computer. The implementation will involve backtracking to create a challenging AI opponent.
